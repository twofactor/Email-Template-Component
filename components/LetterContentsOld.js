  return `Dear member of the Garden Grove City Council,
  
  My name is ${name}, and I am a resident of Garden Grove. I write to you today to make you aware of a disturbing incident that occurred in our city and ask that you take appropriate action. Due to the actions described below, I believe that Garden Grove City Commissioner Josh Lindsay should be removed from his position. 
  
  On June 3, 2020 peaceful protesters gathered in downtown Garden Grove to protest the death of George Floyd and to show support for ourBlack communities. Garden Grove City Planning Commissioner Josh Lindsay began a livestream of the protest from his personal Facebook account, which was broadcasted to the “West Garden Grove Neighborhood Watch” and “Residents and Friends of Garden Grove, CA” Facebook groups. During his 90 minute livestream, which was viewed by at least 2,200 individuals simultaneously, he made several disparaging and inappropriate comments about the protestors and about the cause which they were protesting. 
  
  For example, when protesters began chanting “I can’t breathe,” which were the tragic final words of George Floyd, Commissioner Lindsay commented, “Maybe she should sit down if they’re having so much trouble breathing.” In saying this, Commissioner Lindsay mocked both the incident that led to George Floyd’s horrific death and the peaceful Garden Grove protesters. A video clip of this moment can be found here: https://bit.ly/2Mr9Fym.
  
  Later, protesters gathered and kneeled down at a crosswalk in the street and chanted at the officers in front of them to “Take a knee!” Commissioner Lindsay remarked, “They aren’t going to take a knee. Nor should they.” This act of police solidarity with protesters (which has been seen across the country) signifies that the police at least respect the protesters’ First Amendment right to protest, if not also showing that they respect the protesters’ concerns regarding police brutality. Commissioner Lindsay’s remarks indicate the exact opposite. A video clip of this moment can be found here: https://bit.ly/2Ms5Ita
  
  At one point during the protester’s march, Commissioner Lindsay commented, “We have one of the fairest, fairest police forces around… And for them to have to put up with this, it kinda breaks my heart a little bit.” This comment strongly indicates that Commissioner Lindsay does not respect the protesters’ rights to peaceful protest, nor understand the reason for their protests.

  Commissioner Lindsay’s disparaging remarks are not limited to these examples. A link to Commissioner Lindsay’s entire livestream can be found here: https://bit.ly/2Xza08l. Below is a list of further objectionable comments that Commissioner Lindsay made during his livesteam, which can be found at the corresponding timestamps in the video link above:
  
  1:43 - "There's some of them here that just look like they're here for no good. Straight up no good."
  6:53 - "One of the reasons is I’m trying to get as many faces as I can, because I know about this wonderful thing they have called facial recognition software. Great stuff!"
  8:46 - "I have goggles, because I'm here to peacefully protest - yep, uh huh, sure!" In saying this, Commissioner Lindsay ignores the reality that protesters around the country have been sprayed in the face with pepper spray while peacefully protesting.  
  9:45 - “Oh look at this guy, oh yeah, he’s here for peace. 100%. Oh yeah, 100%.” 
  10:22 - “He’s got some white stuff on his booty. Haha, you’ve got white stuff on your booty.”
  10:47 - "What happened to that man was very, very, very unfortunate… but coming to a community and destroying a community is not cool. Not cool at all.” It is clear from this comment that Commissioner Lindsay pre-judged the protest as something that would inevitably turn violent.
  22:06 - "Just so you know, I'm Commissioner Josh Lindsay." 
  33:55 - "Keep em in line!" 
  1:06:36 - “Alright Brookhurst and Lampson, once again acting a little bit like a fool.” Commissioner Lindsay said as protesters take a knee.
  
  On June 4, 2020, a petition was created, asking that the Garden Grove City Council remove Josh Lindsay from his position. As of the time of this email, that petition has almost 5,000 signatures. A link to the petition can be found here: http://chng.it/tGF7fFs2
  
  On June 4, Commissioner Lindsay issued an apology on his Facebook page. A link to screenshots of this apology can be found here: https://bit.ly/3dCYmPC. Despite his apology, I continue to ask for his removal for the following reasons:
  
  In his apology, Commissioner Lindsay claims that his commentary in the video was reduced to a "few sound bites." However, his comments were consistently disparaging towards the peaceful Garden Grove protesters and the movement they represent and reveal his true character.
