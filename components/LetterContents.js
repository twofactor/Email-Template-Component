  return `Dear member of the Garden Grove City Council,

My name is ${name}, and I am a resident of Garden Grove. I believe that Garden Grove City Commissioner Josh Lindsay should be removed from his position due to comments he made during a Facebook livestream of the peaceful protest that took place on June 3, 2020.

When protestors began chanting “I can’t breathe,” which were the tragic final words of George Floyd, Commissioner Lindsay commented, “Maybe she should sit down if they’re having so much trouble breathing.” In saying this, Commissioner Lindsay mocked both the incident that led to George Floyd’s horrific death and the peaceful Garden Grove protesters. A video clip of this moment can be found here: https://bit.ly/2Mr9Fym.

Throughout his 1.5 hour livestream, Commissioner Lindsay continually made disparaging comments towards the peaceful protesters and the cause for which they were raising attention. A link to Commissioner Lindsay’s entire livestream can be found here: https://bit.ly/2Xza08l. Below is a list of further objectionable comments that Commissioner Lindsay made during his livesteam, which can be found at the corresponding timestamps in the video link above:

1:43 - "There's some of them here that just look like they're here for no good. Straight up no good."
6:53 - "One of the reasons is I’m trying to get as many faces as I can, because I know about this wonderful thing they have called facial recognition software. Great stuff!"
8:46 - "I have goggles, because I'm here to peacefully protest - yep, uh huh, sure!" In saying this, Commissioner Lindsay ignores the reality that protesters around the country have been sprayed in the face with pepper spray while peacefully protesting.  
9:45 - “Oh look at this guy, oh yeah, he’s here for peace. 100%. Oh yeah, 100%.” 
10:22 - “He’s got some white stuff on his booty. Haha, you’ve got white stuff on your booty.”
10:47 - "What happened to that man was very, very, very unfortunate… but coming to a community and destroying a community is not cool. Not cool at all.” It is clear from this comment that Commissioner Lindsay pre-judged the protest as something that would inevitably turn violent.
22:06 - "Just so you know, I'm Commissioner Josh Lindsay." 
33:55 - "Keep em in line!" 
1:06:36 - “Alright Brookhurst and Lampson, once again acting a little bit like a fool.” Commissioner Lindsay said as protesters take a knee.

On June 4, 2020, a petition was created, asking that the Garden Grove City Council remove Josh Lindsay from his position. As of the time of this email, that petition has almost 5,000 signatures. A link to the petition can be found here: http://chng.it/tGF7fFs2

On June 4, Commissioner Lindsay issued an apology on his Facebook page. A link to screenshots of this apology can be found here: https://bit.ly/3dCYmPC. Despite his apology, I continue to ask for his removal for the following reasons:
1. Commissioner Lindsay responded very poorly to criticism of his apology in the comments on his post. Commissioner Lindsay claims in response to a comment by Sarah Perry that "if you knew 1/100th of what all I do for this community your head would spin." That comment and his response can be found here: https://bit.ly/2Mx7HfX. It is clear from his response that he believes that his past service can make up for the pain he caused our community. In addition, it is clear that he does not truly understand why folks are upset. Lastly, it is also clear that he is incapable of maturely receiving and responding to criticism. It is clear that he does not represent our values, and that he should not be in a position that represents the city.
2. Commissioner Lindsay's apology, as highlighted by Sarah Perry's comment, was lacking in many ways. Although he claims to be upset by the death of George Floyd, he mocked both his death and the peaceful protesters in Garden Grove during his livestream, and he failed to acknowledge or apologize for this specifically. Commissioner Lindsay furthermore failed to state how he will use his privilege and position of power to continue learning and effectuate change in his community.
3. In his apology, Commissioner Lindsay claims that his commentary in the video was reduced to a "few sound bites." However, his comments were consistently disparaging towards the peaceful Garden Grove protesters and the movement they represent and reveal his true character.
  
To the Honorable members of the Garden Grove City Council and Mayor Jones, I ask you for your support in voting for Commissioner Lindsay’s removal, pursuant to Garden Grove Municipal Code §2.02.020 and §2.21.04.

I hope that this will be a step in a positive direction, such that residents of Garden Grove are represented in a more respectful manner and that our city continues to thrive together. 

Respectfully, 

${name}, resident of Garden Grove
